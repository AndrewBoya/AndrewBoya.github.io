  You'll want to expand this component (and others) for the sprints! Remember 
  that you can pass "props" as function arguments. If you need to handle state 
  at a higher level, just move up the hooks and pass the state/setter as a prop.
  
  This is a great top level component for the REPL. It's a good idea to have organize all components in a component folder.
  You don't need to do that for this gearup.
