## Nim Directory
This is a very simple HTML and CSS file. It is provided as a reference for basic HTML style and code convention. In Mock, you will be building a React application, so it may not look *exactly* the same, but the general conventions are similar.

For the Gear Up, you do not need to worry about this directory.
